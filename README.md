# MPOS Compatability
I (ocminer) removed levelDB and added MySQL / MariaSQL support to this branch of ethpool-go. Furthermore the shares are inserted into MySQL so that a MPOS based pool can work with those shares. 
You still have to modify MPOS to get the RPC working with ETH/GETH - contact me in case of questions (my address is admin at suprnova dot cc)

The rest of this README is from the original ethpool/leveldb implementation:
# Introduction
We have decided to open source our implementation of pooled mining for Ethereum. This software is not a complete mining pool. It only takes care of work distribution and share validation; valid shares are stored into a local database (LevelDB). Reward calculation and payments are not yet implemented but it should be possible to connect this software some of the  existing open source mining pools.

# Performance
While the current implementation in go might not be the most effective one, the pool was able to process ~600 workers at 30% CPU utilization (1 core) and 70MB RAM usage.

# Supported clients
The pool has been tested successfully with both the go Ethereum client (geth) and the cpp Ethereum client (eth).

# Pull requests & possible optimizations
If you find any issues with the pool software please feel free to issue a pull request.

If you want to improve the pool, implementing the connection to geth via IPC instead of HTTP would be a good start.

# Setup guide (Ubuntu 14.04)
* Install go according to https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installing-Go#ubuntu-1404
* Put the pool.go file into your `gopath`
* Run `$ go get` to download the dependencies
* Adjust the ports to match your environment (poolPort and ethereumPort)
* Start your Ethereum client & enable RPC
* Run `$ go build pool.go`
* Start the pool server `$ ./pool`
* Point your miner to `http://ip:port/\<account\>.\<worker\>/\<hashrate\>`
